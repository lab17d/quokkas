					<h1><center>What is threatening the quokkas?</center></h1>
					<center>The quokka’s population has been in steady decline since the time of colonial settlement. Why is that? Below are three of the biggest things that are quokkas.</center>

						</div>

						<div class="col-8" style="padding: 40px;">
							<p>The area that they can inhabit is shrinking rapidly as humans have cleared and developed bushland through logging, housing, and agricultural development. Compounding this are the devastating wildfires that burn through the mainland, killing quokkas who live within the burnt area and stripping it of what any surviving quokkas need to live.</p>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-8" style="padding: 40px;">
							<p>Originally widely distributed across the southwest of Australia, settlement of the continent by Europeans introduced populations of foxes and feral cats, both of which preyed upon quokkas while also being able to navigate the thick bush of its habitat, dramatically reducing their population to the numbers we see today.</p>

						<div class="col-8" style="padding: 40px;">
							<p>Quokkas have little fear of humans and are very approachable- but while these friendly animals make for great photo ops, people with good intentions encountering quokkas in the wild may attempt to feed them, which is very detrimental to their health. Human food is very dehydrating for quokkas, along with lacking nutrition vital to quokkas, as they can only digest plants.</p>

							<p>The means to protect the quokka and its environments overlap with more general conservation efforts already, and so aren’t difficult to expand those efforts to encompass the quokka specifically. Wildfire protection and prevention are of extreme importance in the Australian bushland, especially in southwestern Australia (quokka territory), which is particularly wildfire prone. Additionally, their primary predators on the mainland, feral foxes and cats, are both invasive to the Australian ecology and pests to agricultural development.</p>

							<p>The quokka has many fascinating adaptations that help it survive in the harsh Australian outback; they use their light brown coat to blend in with the scrub around them during the day, which also helps them shrug off the sun’s rays. As genetic cousins to kangaroos, they can move and jump surprisingly large distances with their powerful hind legs and big feet, as well as balancing on them to use their front paws. They also have impressive heat regulation abilities, able to survive up to 44°C (111°F!), and can go months without a sip of water. They’ve even been observed drinking saltwater when freshwater is scarce!</p>

							<p>Quokkas are curious, friendly, and very, very cute. They’ve been called “the world’s happiest animals” because of their pudgy cheeks and big smiles, and are a major tourist attraction on Rottnest Island. They’re just all around adorable little goobers.</p>
